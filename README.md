Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and GitHub

Welcome to the world of coding and collaboration on GitHub! This step-by-step guide will help you set up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and connect it to your GitHub account.

1. Install Visual Studio Code:
   a. Visit the official VSCode website (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
   b. Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

2. Set Up Git:
   a. Install Git on your local machine by downloading it from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and following the installation instructions.
   b. During the installation, choose the appropriate options for your operating system and accept the default settings.

3. Configure Git:
   a. Open VSCode and click on the "Extensions" icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   b. Search for the "Git" extension and click on "Install" to install it.
   c. After the installation, restart VSCode.
   d. Open the integrated terminal in VSCode by going to "View" > "Terminal" (or press `Ctrl+` backtick `).
   e. Set your name and email for Git by running the following commands in the terminal, replacing `<your_name>` and `<your_email>` with your actual information:
      ```
      git config --global user.name "<your_name>"
      git config --global user.email "<your_email>"
      ```

4. Connect VSCode to GitHub:
   a. Sign in to your GitHub account (https://github.com) or create a new account if you don't have one.
   b. In VSCode, click on the Source Control icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`).
   c. Click on the "Sign in to GitHub" button in the Source Control tab.
   d. Follow the prompts to authorize VSCode to access your GitHub account.

5. Clone a GitHub Repository:
   a. Go to the repository you want to clone on GitHub.
   b. Click on the "Code" button and copy the URL.
   c. In VSCode, click on the "Clone Repository" button in the Source Control tab.
   d. Paste the URL into the input box and choose the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   e. Click "Clone" to download the repository to your local machine.

6. Start Coding and Committing:
   a. Open the cloned repository in VSCode by going to "File" > "Open Folder" and selecting the repository folder.
   b. Make changes to the code or add new files as needed.
   c. In the Source Control tab, you will see the changes you've made. Click on the "+" button next to each file or use the "Stage All Changes" button to stage your changes for commit.
   d. Enter a meaningful commit message in the input box at the top of the Source Control tab and click on the checkmark button to commit your changes.
   e. Click on the ellipsis button in the Source Control tab and choose "Push" to push your commits to the GitHub repository.

You're now set up with Visual Studio Code and GitHub! You can continue coding, making changes, and collaborating with others using Git and GitHub within the VSCode environment.
